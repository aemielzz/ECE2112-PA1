I declared def to define the function emoticon(a):. The return function to execute the code so we can replace the following variables. a.replace will help us replace the text in an emoticon a.replace ("smile",": )"). replace will replace the word smile into an emoticon when we input a sentence that involves the word smile, it's the same with grin, mad, and sad. As you can see I declared print (emoticon("you always make me smile")) and when the code was executed the word smile was replaced with the emoticon : ). The same with the word sad.
## 3. UNPACKING LIST PROBLEM: Unpack the list write yourcode here into three variables, being first, middle, and last, with middle being everything in between the first and last element. Then print all three variables.

First, I declared T as the name of all the variables in the list and made sure to put quotation marks and brackets. After inputting the data, I declared print ("first:", T[0],) to print the zeroth variable which is luneta. I also declared "middle:",T[1:3], to print the first variable up until before the 3rd variable, This results to  intramuros and fort santiago. For the last one I declared "last: ",T[-1], which resulted to binondo because if you are counting the variables starting from the right it is considered -1 and so on and so forth"
