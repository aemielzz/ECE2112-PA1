First, I declared T as the name of all the variables in the list and made sure to put quotation marks and brackets. After inputting the data, I declared print ("first:", T[0],) to print the zeroth variable which is luneta. I also declared "middle:",T[1:3], to print the first variable up until before the 3rd variable, This results to  intramuros and fort santiago. For the last one I declared "last: ",T[-1], which resulted to binondo because if you are counting the variables starting from the right it is considered -1 and so on and so forth"
